=== Intro

There are several ways to install and use docToolchain.
In this tutorial, I will show you the preferred way through SDKMAN!.

https://sdkman.io[SDKMAN!] is a software development kit manager which lets you install several tools and switch between versions of the same tool in a convenient way.

When you are finished with this scenario, you will have docToolchain installed as command line tool.

This tutorial will take aprox. 10 minutes of your time.

Let's get started with the first step.

[[step1]]
=== Step 1: Install SDKMAN!

First you have to install SDKMAN!.
If you work on your own environment and already have it installed, you can skip this step.

This step assumes that you have `curl` and `unzip` installed on your machine.

The following command will install SDKMAN!
Please copy it over to the terminal and execute it.

    curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash

After a short moment, you will see that is has been installed.
In order to stay in the same terminal, you still need to execute

    source "/root/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

in order to initialize it in this terminal.
When you start a new terminal, it will be already initialized.
