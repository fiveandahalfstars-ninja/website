In two previous posts ([Grails3.0](https://rdmueller.github.io/Spock-Reports-with-Grails-3.0/) & [Grails2.2](https://rdmueller.github.io/Spock-Reports-with-Grails-2.2/)) I described how to use [Spock-Reports](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/spock-reports) with [Grails 3.0](http://www.grails.org) and Grails 2.2. 

Now, if you try to use it with Grails 2.5, it seems not to work from the start. The main problem I noticed was that even
when I run a trivial app and all spock tests are auto-created, I got an error message at the end of the tests: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31440381/forked-grails-vm-exited-with-error-while-running-test-app#comment50863764_31440381

So I tried to get rid of this error message by not forking the VM when running tests. To do that, simply set the fork-configuration
to `false` for the test environments (in `BuildConfig.groovy`)

```groovy
grails.project.fork = [
    ...
    test: false,
    ...
]
```

Now, the rest seems to work the same as with Grails 2.2.4 with the only difference that Grails 2.5 uses Spock out of the box. 
So we don't habe to configure it:

just open your `grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy` file and add

```groovy
repositories {
  [...]
  //for spock-reports
  mavenRepo "http://jcenter.bintray.com"
}
```

to the `repositories` section and

```groovy
dependencies {
  [...]
  //for spock-reports
  test 'com.athaydes:spock-reports:1.2.5'  
}
```

to the `dependencies` section.

The standard reports are now generated and stored in `build/spock-reports/.`.

### Customizing your Reports

In order to store the generated reports in `target/test-reports/spock/.` you have to customize your reports as described in the [documentation](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/spock-reports#customizing-the-reports), you have to create a file called `META-INF/services/com.athaydes.spockframework.report.IReportCreator.properties`. 
That sounds easier than it is, because it has to be in the classpath and for some Grails projects, it's not easy to find the right folder to put it.

For Grails 2.5, you will succeed by putting it in `grails-app/conf/META-INF/services/com.athaydes.spockframework.report.IReportCreator.properties`.

Here is a sample file which uses the template based reports:

```groovy
# Name of the implementation class of the report creator
# Currently supported classes are:
#   1. com.athaydes.spockframework.report.internal.HtmlReportCreator
#   2. com.athaydes.spockframework.report.template.TemplateReportCreator
com.athaydes.spockframework.report.IReportCreator=com.athaydes.spockframework.report.template.TemplateReportCreator

# Output directory (where the spock reports will be created) - relative to working directory
com.athaydes.spockframework.report.outputDir=target/test-reports/spock

# If set to true, hides blocks which do not have any description
com.athaydes.spockframework.report.hideEmptyBlocks=false

# Set properties of the report creator
com.athaydes.spockframework.report.template.TemplateReportCreator.specTemplateFile=/spockreporttemplate/spec-template.md
com.athaydes.spockframework.report.template.TemplateReportCreator.reportFileExtension=md
com.athaydes.spockframework.report.template.TemplateReportCreator.summaryTemplateFile=/spockreporttemplate/summary-template.md
com.athaydes.spockframework.report.template.TemplateReportCreator.summaryFileName=summary.md
```

this file specifies that the templates are located in `grails-app/conf/spockreporttemplates` and the output
will be written to `target/test-reports/spock`. A good idea is to start with the default templates [spec-template.md](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/spock-reports/blob/master/src/main/resources/templateReportCreator/spec-template.md) and [summary-template.md](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/spock-reports/blob/master/src/main/resources/templateReportCreator/summary-template.md)
