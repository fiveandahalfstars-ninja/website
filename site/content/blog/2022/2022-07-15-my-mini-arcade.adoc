Lately, I did some studies to learn how to better design for 3D printing.
One of the outcomes is a tiny arcade cabinet.

More than 12 years ago, I already had the idea to create {uri-blogspot}[my own mini arcade].
Back then, my skills where limited :-D

This blog post will document the decisions and technology behind my ideas.

== Three Brothers

The goal is to build three different versions of my mini arcade with different features.

=== The Minimalist

The smallest screen I found, with a usable resolution is an 0.96 inch I2C OLED 128x64.
Since this screen has only a color depth of 2, a simple arduino based controller should be enough.

*Main Challenge*: code some arcade like demo for the screen.

*Second Challenge*: a bluetooth controller would be great, but it seems that the arduino libraries can only play the slave part
and hence can not directly connect to a bluetooth game pad.


=== The Multi-Talent

A Raspberry Pi Zero is small enough to fit into a slightly bigger mini arcade.
With linux as operating system, enough memory on board and even WiFi, it is quite powerful.
It is able to simulate the real arcade machines and home computer systems of the past.
And you will even be able to connect a bluetooth game controller to make the arcade even playable.

*Main Challenge*: find a small screen which can be used as output for the emulator.

=== The rare Specialist

I still have the original handheld game with sonic on board and the display extension cable.
This will result in the largest but still small arcade cabinet.

== The Guides

let's get started with

=== The Multi-Talent

The Display I want to go with is an IPS 240x240 screen with SPI:

Most tutorials show how to control such a display via python.
Some also show how the standard HDMI framebuffer can be copied to the display.

==== Control via Python

Let's start with python to see if the display is working at all.

\... two days later.
Wow.
This wasn't as easy as I thought.
Here are my learnings.

The https://github.com/pimoroni/st7789-python[python library st7789] works quite well, if you get the parameters right.
A certain https://techatronic.com/st7789-raspberry-pi/[blockpost] helped me most.

Here is my wiring between the pi zero and the display:

[options="header"]
|===
| Display | other name | GPIO | PIN
| GND     | 0V         | -    | 6
| VCC     | 3.3V       | -    | 17
| SCL     | SCLK, CLK  | 11   | 23
| SDA     | MOSI       | 10   | 19
| RES     | CS?        | 25   | 22
| DC      | Data Control | 24 | 18
| BLK     | BackLight Kontrol :-) | 27 | 13
|===

The two power pins GND and VCC should be trivial to wire.

SCL and SDA are part of the SPI bus.
The rasperry has two hardware implementations of the SPI protocol.
Normally, you will use SPI0 (remember to enable it in `raspi-config`).
Thus, these two pins are also fix.

The remaining three can be put on any GPIO you like, but you need to configure them the right way in your code.

The following code (taken from above blog post) works for me:

[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio python3-spidev python3-pil python3-numpy
----

[source, python]
----
import ST7789
from PIL import Image
from time import sleep
display=ST7789.ST7789(port=0,cs=0,rst=25,dc=24,backlight=27,spi_speed_hz=160000000)
display._spi.mode=3
display.reset()
display._init()
image=Image.new('RGB',(240,240),(255,0,0))  #('RGB',(240,240),(r,g,b))
display.display(image)
sleep(2)
image=Image.open("image5.jpg")
image=image.resize((240,240),resample=Image.LANCZOS)

display.display(image)
----

With this knowledge, I also managed to get the pimorony examples from above git repository up and running.

WARNING: I had lots of problems to get the display up and running.
It turns out, that the line `display._spi.mode=3` was the key to success.
Other displays seem to work out of the box, mine needs `spi.mode=3`.
And this was also the key to get the framebuffer up and running in the next section.


NOTE: it seems that this method gets us 8 FPS at most.

==== Automatic copy of Framebuffer

Not that we are sure that we have a working hardware setup, let's see what kind of magic we can apply with framebuffers.

setup pi with network over usb: https://github.com/rdmueller/Offline-Digital-Signage-for-Conferences---ODSFC

=== Install Recallbox

Use the Raspberry Pi Imager to install RetroPie for the Raspberry Pi Zero 1.

Add a file called `wpa_supplication.conf` to the image in order to setup WiFi:

[source]
----
country=DE
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="WiFi_SSID"
    scan_ssid=1
    psk="WiFi_PASSWORD"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
----

...and an empty file called `ssh` to activate ssh access.

Use ssh to connect to your RetroPie and start the config via `sudo ~/RetroPie-Setup/retropie_setup.sh`
It will take some time for the config to start up.

`Configuration` > `Bluetooth`

see the https://retropie.org.uk/docs/8Bitdo-Controller/[RetroPie docs] for details.

NOTE: Since I don't know which key `R1` should be, I figured out that ´start`+`B` does the trick for my 8Bitdo zero.
Use this combo to start the controller.
The LED should blink twice in blue.
Verify the correct mode by connecting it to a PC.
It should act as a bluetooth keyboard and emit one character per keypress.
(`start`+`A` will give two characters per keypress.)

NOTE: Since the controller is connected as keyboard, the "setup controller" screen will tell you that no controller is connected.
Just press and hold a key and setup a keyboard controller.


[source, bash]
----
cmake -DST7789=ON
  -DGPIO_TFT_DATA_CONTROL=24
  -DGPIO_TFT_RESET_PIN=25
  -DSPI_BUS_CLOCK_DIVISOR=30
  -DGPIO_TFT_BACKLIGHT=27
  -DSTATISTICS=0
  -DDISPLAY_BREAK_ASPECT_RATIO_WHEN_SCALING=OFF
  -DBACKLIGHT_CONTROL=ON
  -DUSE_DMA_TRANSFERS=OFF ..
