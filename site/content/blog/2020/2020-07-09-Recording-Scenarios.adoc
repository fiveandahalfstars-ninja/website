To reach a bigger audience, I like to record my talks.
It started out with noticing that Bernd RÃ¼cker recorded one of his talks at the Entwicklertag Frankfurt.
Immediately after his talk, he started to post-process and upload his video in the hallway.
I used this chance to talk to him and got my first tips & tricks to start with.

Meanwhile, I have recorded several talks of my own and noticed that I have three different, very distinct scenarios.

== Scenario One: Live, on site

These where my typical talks before corona.

- You are on site in front of your audience.
- You do not have much influence on the setting, the environment.
- You need to record your screen, audio and speaker video.

Since you have no influence on the environment, you can't use a greenscreen.
And since it is a live performance, you only have one take.
As it turn out, this is good, because recording will only take as long as your talk.

With OBS Studio, you can record the second screen with your presentation and video of an external webcam together with a connected microphone.
Both videos will be side by side, and you can mix them together in the post-production.

The performance of OBS in such a situation is quite good, even on an intel i5 processor.

component Webcam
cloud "internet" {
    component youtube

node notebook {
    database hdd
    component "OBS-Studio" as obs
    file ".mp4" as mp4

    obs -> hdd : record
    hdd -> [camtasia]
    camtasia -> mp4 : postprocessing
}
Micro -down-> obs
Webcam -down-> obs
mp4 -> youtube : upload

The result will look something like this

This seems to be an easy scenario, but as it turns out, it is the hardest.
I have not one single recording of myself where it worked out flawless.
There are too many things which could fail:

- you miss to hit the recording button.
Even if you only miss to record the slides, it is too hard to fix this in the post-processing.
- microphone might not work.
We once had the situation that by mistake we used the build in microphone.
The resulting quality was unusable.
- you might walk out of sight for the camara or there is another reason why the camera view is trash.
Next time, I will use two cameras, one of them with a fish-eye.
- performance problems.
Even tho your machine "only" has to record the video, it might run into performance problems.
This will result in dropped frames and this overall poor video quality.
- audio and video out of sync.
I first tried to record with an external camera and external microphone.
Both where not only out of sync, but there was a constant drift.
To fix the video, I would have re-sync both every 4 minutes.
That's why I now only record from sources which are directly attached to the recording machine.

== Scenario Two: Live, but at home

Things changed with the pandemic.
All talks where canceled or turned into online ones where you present your ideas just infront of your screen without seeing your audience.

browser -down-> vc : WebRTC
vc -> vc : record
vc -up-> hdd : download\nrecording
Micro -down-> obs
Webcam -down-> obs
mp4 -> youtube : upload

== Scenario Three: Pre-Record

== Scenario Four: Beeing Recorded

Bonus :-) One of the best situations is when someone else records your talk.
In this case, it is the responsible of some one else to synchronize audio and video and to capture your display video.
Perfect :-)
