It is quite a while now that most of us switched to working from home.
Some of us have not seen their office space since the start of the pandemic.
I've already tweetet a photo of my last conference setup from the view of my camera.
But how does my desk look like at the moment?

Since I was forced to tidy up my work space, I thought it could be a good idea to take a photo.
I love to see the working desk of others to get some fresh ideas on how I could improve mine.
So, today I decided to show you my desk and I will go a bit into detail about everything you see.

When Corona started, I had a simple desk with a second monitor which I rarely used (the notebook screen is often enough for me).

But when I noticed that the situation will last for a longer period (and I guess we will never return to what we where used to), I started to invest in my new work place.

== Webcam

When one of our local Tech-Stores re-opend after the first lock-down, the tried to get some customers with some bargains.
One of those was a Canon EOS 2000D for less than 300â‚¬.
And since canon had jsut announced the release of a webcam driver for their cameras, I wanted to give it a try.

I also had to by a dummy battery to keep it powerd through a USB charger and a tripod to mount it above my monitor.
It works quite nice and I got used to it by now that every time it is activated, it takes some time to initialize itself.
The main drawback is the missing autofocus.

== Illumination

As you can see, the desk is located right in front of a window.
Most of the time, I get good sunlight.
At other times, I have too much light or not enough light at all.
This depends on the time of day and can vary during a meeting.

So I installed a cheap ringlight (29â‚¬) and an IKEA lamp which I alread had.
Both together result in good illumination when the sun is away, but you can still see the difference.

== CO2-Meter

From people like Simon Harrer and Gernot Starke, I learned that a CO2-Meter is quite helpful to check the air quality.
It reminds be every now and then to let some fresh air in and to take a break.

== "Whiteboard"

Do you remember those discussions over some quick drawings on the whiteboard?
I missed them so much that I came up with this design.

The old logitec C920 web-cam is mounted above a small pile of papers.
This lets me easily share my thoughts with colleagues.

== Green Screen

Underneath the table, there is enough room to store my foldable green screen.

I use it mainly when I give a talk to replace my background with one provided by my employer.

== Alexa and Headphones

These two help me to enter the flow and to have a pomodoro timer always at hand.


== (hidden) USB Charger

All my devices are wireless, but they need a place to recharge.
All the cables needed for the charger where such a mess, that I needed a solution.

Hindden in these two drawers are six USB charging cables (two USB-c and 4 USB-micro) which are powered by one charger mounted behind the monitor stand.

As you can easily see, I came up with this solution before I noticed that I need so many other cable on which I then simply gave up ðŸ¤£.
But I still love this solution - all my charging devices are "sleeping" in those two drawers...

== X-Box and Super NES

[.text-center]

When it is time for a break, I like to use the X-Box or Super NES to play a quick and relaxing game.
But most of the time, these to boxes help me to finish my day in time, because my kids want to play :-)
