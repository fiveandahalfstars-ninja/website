This week I wanted to load test a {uri-grails}[grails] application under real conditions.
So I needed a simple way to deploy a grails application to a real server (not my notebook).

So, I asked my followers on twitter and mastodon, what cloud service I should use.

I quickly got a response from {uri-patrick}[Patrick Baumgartner] to use {uri-fly-io}[fly.io] as a service.

A quick check showed me that fly.io seems to be really a simple service with a good free tier.

Let's see how you can deploy your grails app to fly.io ...

== Setup a Grails Starter

First, go to https://start.grails.org/ and download a starter app.
Since I didn't modify the defaults, a simple

[source, bash]
----
curl -O https://start.grails.org/myapp.zip
unzip myapp.zip
----

also does the trick.
You can now create some simple domain objects as described in the quick start guide "{uri-guide}[Creating your first Grails Application]" - but you don't have to.
The basic application template will be enough to test the deployment to fly.io .

Now, modify the app to create a fat-jar file instead of a .war .
Remove the reference to the `war` plugin from the `build.gradle` config (line 19):

[source, groovy]
----
//apply plugin:"war"
----

In order to avoid having to set up a database, I also modified the production configuration to use an in-memory database.
In `grails-app/conf/application.yml`, I copied the development datasource over to the production one (line 122):

.grails-app/conf/application.yml
[source, yaml]
----
production:
    dataSource:
        dbCreate: create-drop
        url: jdbc:h2:mem:devDb;LOCK_TIMEOUT=10000;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE

----

== ... and deploy to fly.io

Next, create a simple `Dockerfile` with the following content:

.Dockerfile
[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM openjdk:14-ea-alpine3.10

EXPOSE 8080

WORKDIR /app
COPY *.jar application.jar

CMD ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","/app/application.jar"]
----

WARNING: yes, this is not perfect. It is just a quick hack.

Now, everything is prepared for the last few steps.
To test your grails app, execute the following steps on the command line:

[source]
----
./grailsw package
cp build/libs/myapp-0.1.jar .
docker build --tag="grails-sample/complete:0.1" .
docker run -p 8080:8080 grails-sample/complete:0.1
----

This will test-run your app locally as docker image.

To deploy it to fly.io, execute

[source]
----
./grailsw package
cp build/libs/myapp-0.1.jar .
fly launch
fly apps list
----

Hope this little guide will help you with your own deployment.
